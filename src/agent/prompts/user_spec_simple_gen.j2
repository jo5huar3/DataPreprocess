{% if rag_context %}
Relevant Cryptol knowledge (for your analysis only — do not quote verbatim and do not include any code in the instruction):
-----8<-----
{{ rag_context }}
-----8<-----
{% endif %}

Task: Generate exactly ONE AlpacaRow as JSON with keys: instruction, input, output.

Hard rules:
- The instruction MUST be standalone: the assistant who will write the Cryptol specification will NOT have access to the code_excerpt or rag_context.
- The instruction must request ONLY Cryptol source code.
- Do NOT include any Cryptol snippets or fenced code blocks in the instruction.
  - No triple backticks, no inline backticks, and do not paste lines from the excerpt or RAG context.
- Set input to "" (empty string).
- Set output to "" (empty string).

Length rules (STRICT):
- Keep the instruction <= {{ instruction_max_words }} words.
- Detail level: {{ instruction_detail_level }}.
{% if is_thin_wrapper %}
- This file is a thin wrapper/specialization. Do NOT describe the underlying algorithm or add extra API/features not implied by the excerpt.
{% endif %}

Terminology rule (STRICT):
{% if has_module_header %}
- Use the word "module" in the instruction and request a Cryptol module implementation.
{% else %}
- Do NOT use the word "module" in the instruction; request Cryptol snippet/specification/code/definitions only (module is a keyword and this is not a module).
{% endif %}

Code excerpt (context for you only; never copy verbatim into the instruction):
-----8<-----
{{ code_excerpt }}
-----8<-----
