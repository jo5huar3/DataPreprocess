{% if rag_context %}
Relevant Cryptol knowledge (for your analysis only — do not quote verbatim and do not include any code in the instruction):
-----8<-----
{{ rag_context }}

{% endif %}

Task: Generate exactly ONE AlpacaRow as JSON with keys: instruction, input, output.

Hard rules:
- The instruction MUST be standalone: the assistant who will write the Cryptol file will NOT see this excerpt.
- The instruction must request ONLY Cryptol source code (do NOT ask for SAWScript, external proofs, or non-Cryptol artifacts).
- Do NOT include any Cryptol snippets or fenced code blocks in the instruction.
  - No triple backticks, no inline backticks, and do not paste lines from the excerpt or RAG context.
  - You may mention module/function names and describe types/IO in prose, but do not format them as code.
- Set input to "" (empty string).
- Set output to "" (empty string).
- Keep the instruction <= 150 words.

Code excerpt (context for you only; never copy verbatim into the instruction):
-----8<-----
{{ code_excerpt }}
-----8<-----
