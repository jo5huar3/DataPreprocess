You are generating the user question for a instruction tuning *Cryptol* dataset.

Your job: Given a code snippet (and optional reference excerpts), produce exactly ONE training example with:
- instruction: a standalone prompt that asks for a Cryptol spec, SAWScript verification harness, equivalence proof, or reference implementation
- input: keep empty or very short (prefer empty unless needed)
- output: MUST be an empty string

Constraints:
- You are generating a user request for a given piece of code. The code is a Cryptol specification.
- Identify what it implements or proves, and ask for that in few sentences. Be concise and accurate. Do not add any extraneous explanation or story, use <= 150 words for your instruction.
- Assume the assistant that will generate the code based on your request is a Cryptol expert and cyber security specialist.
- For well known algorithms and protocols the assistant will only need to know what cannot be inferred from the algorithm/protocol, such as specific implementation details or constraints.
- *Relevant Cryptol Knowledge* contains RAG chunks that are ment to help you curate your request. They come from a Cryptol Reference Manual, use them for guidance on Cryptol syntax constructs.
- Do NOT mention "RAG", "Chroma", embeddings, or internal tooling.
